                <p>
                    Kul Man Ghising served as CEO of the Nepal Electricity Authority from september 14, 2016 
                    to september 16, 2020 and was appointed for another term on August 11, 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Load shedding had been a recurring problem in Nepal for decades, with up to 18 hours of power 
                    interruption per day in the dry months of the year. The main cause was that some customers were 
                    receiving an interrupted supply of electricity at the expanse of everyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kul Man ended this practice, almost completely solving the load shedding problem within two 
                    months of taking office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By May 2018, the load shedding problem in Nepal was entirely solved.
                </p>
                <h2 id="load-shedding">What is load shedding?</h2>
                <p>
                    Load shedding is a planned interruption of power distribution to certain geographical areas 
                    in order to reduce demand on the energy generation system.
